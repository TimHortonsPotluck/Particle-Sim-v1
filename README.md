Little particle sim



I think the entire "Release" folder is necessary in order for it to run, but I don't know. You can click the mouse to add more particles. 


I really should come back and clean this up (and make a proper UI...) but I haven't yet. I will probably put parts of this in future work (and I've already done this somewhat). Would like to add the ability to specify number of particles and some of the physical constants before running, but that's more work and it's not the fun kind.
